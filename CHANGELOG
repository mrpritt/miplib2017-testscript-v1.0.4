CHANGELOG
=========

Version 1.0.2
-------------

- new get_instances.sh script to faciliate instances download
- new testsets/ subdirectory that already contains benchmark.test
- solu file that contains best known objectives for all instances included. You may periodically check the availability of a newer version from the website.
- solution checker supports new fixFile parameter for writing a bounds section in MPS format for fixing all integer variables

Version 1.0.1
-------------

- new Python script cpx2solchecker.py to convert from CPLEX SOL FORMAT to Solchecker format.
this fixes problems of the previous conversion that could not properly translate certain XML specific character encodings.
