This folder should contain the binaries or soft-links to the solver.

EXAMPLE

   - bin/cbc -> /usr/bin/cbc
   - bin/cplex -> /usr/bin/cplex
   - bin/gurobi -> /usr/bin/gurobi_cl
   - bin/mosek -> /usr/bin/mosek
   - bin/scip -> /usr/bin/scip.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx
   - bin/xpress -> /usr/bin/xpress

Additionally, for running permuted instances, you need a softlink
named "bin/permute" pointing to a SCIP binary of version 4.0 or higher.
